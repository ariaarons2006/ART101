            <h1> Sonic the Hedgehog Wiki </h1>  
            Born on Christmas Island, Sonic abandoned his home at an early age to pursue a life of adventures. He has spent most of his life traveling around the world and beyond, usually accompanied by his best friend, Tails. In his journeys, he has defended his world and others from various threats, especially his arch-nemesis, Dr. Eggman.

Described as being "like the wind", Sonic is easygoing and honest, but also impatient and short-tempered. He possesses a strong sense of independence and justice, despises oppression, and is loyal to his friends. His many adventures have earned him many titles, allies, and foes, and made him a celebrated hero. However, he remains indifferent to his fame, preferring to live on his own terms.

Sonic was conceived to replace Alex Kidd as Sega's mascot and boost the company's popularity. He was chiefly created by Naoto Ohshima, Yuji Naka, and Hirokazu Yasuhara. He was designed to appeal to Americans, and thus his creators drew inspiration from the cultural and political landscape of the United States. Sonic debuted in 1991's Sonic the Hedgehog, whose success allowed Sega to compete against Nintendo throughout the 1990s, but had made a cameo earlier in the racing game Rad Mobile. The character was redesigned by Yuji Uekawa for 1998's Sonic Adventure, to allow for more flexibility in 3D spaces. Sonic remains one of the most famous video game characters and has starred in other mediums, like TV shows, comics, and films.

    <h2> Creation and Design </h2> 
While several people were involved in Sonic's creation, the artist Naoto Ohshima, programmer Yuji Naka, and designer Hirokazu Yasuhara are generally credited as the character's co-creators.[1]

Prior to Sonic's creation, this rabbit character would have been Sega's mascot, but was discarded because his movement would break the gameplay flow.[16][17]

In April 1990, Sega sought a new mascot to rival Nintendo's Mario.[18][19][20] The company had previously used Alex Kidd as their mascot, but that character was considered too similar to Mario.[18] Sega's AM8 R&D department submitted several designs, including a wolf, bulldog, robot, and warrior character. An early idea by Ohshima was a rabbit who could grab objects with his ears, but was found too slow and complex for the Sega Mega Drive's hardware.[21][18][20][22][23] Naka, who had joined Ohshima as a programmer, wanted a fast-paced yet simple game. Conceptualizing a rolling attack, the duo, supervised by Yasuhara, researched animals that could naturally roll, arriving at a shortlist of an armadillo and a hedgehog. The latter was chosen due to the spikes' visual appeal.[17][16] Around the same time, Ohshima took a trip to New York City and conducted an informal survey in Central Park, where he showed people sketches of various character designs, including a hedgehog, a dog, and a character that would later become Doctor Eggman. The hedgehog design proved the most popular, reinforcing the team's choice.[23]

Sonic's base design was based off an originally discarded sketch of a character named "Mr. Hedgehog",[note 1][24] by Ohshima. The team settled on Sonic's final name to represent speed and took the name Sonic Team.[25][26] Sonic was designed to be easy for children to draw.[23] His pigment of blue was adjusted several times during development to match Sega's logo and for higher contrast against backgrounds.[19][27][28] Ohshima combined Felix the Cat's head with Mickey Mouse's body for Sonic's design, with inspiration from the cover for Michael Jackson's album Bad and Santa Claus's costume for Sonic's shoes.[29][19] Sonic was created without the ability to swim because of Naka's mistaken assumption that hedgehogs could not do so.[30]

    <h3> Personality and Backstory </h3> 
    Sonic's personality was defined by three pillars that aligned with Sega's image: "cool", "challenger", and a backstory.[23] He was made to appeal to American audiences, under the belief that success in the US would attract Japanese consumers. He was made impulsive, which Ohshima saw as representative of Americans, and influenced by Bill Clinton's "get it done" attitude.[31][32][33] Ohshima and Yasuhara wrote a backstory, influenced by World War II-era aviation imagery, that featured a jet pilot nicknamed "Hedgehog" due to his spiked hair, who had Sonic's likeness emblazoned on his flight jacket and plane as nose art. According to this story, the games were set in a children's story written by the pilot's wife.[23] Early concepts gave Sonic fangs and put him in a band with a human girlfriend named Madonna, ideas scrapped by Sega of America to keep his identity simple. After disputes between Sega's American and Japanese branches, Sonic's backstory was infused with environmental themes, contrasting his personification of nature with the antagonist, Dr. Eggman, representing industry and science.[17][34][19]

Radmobile
Sonic's very first appearance was in Rad Mobile, released for arcades in October 1990, as an ornament hanging on the rear view mirror.

Sonic's first major video game appearance was in Sonic the Hedgehog, released in summer 1991. However, as anticipation for that game grew within Sega, the character had also made cameos in a few other games, particularly in Rad Mobile–regarded as Sonic's earliest game appearance–as a car ornament, and in Puzzle Construction alongside Dr. Eggman.[35] Sonic's proportions were adjusted for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, with the original head-to-height ratio changed from 1:2 to 1:2.5.[36] During the series' early years, Western material did some modifications to his design, such as sharper eyes and a mohawk-like hairstyle, but these were slowly phased out as the Japanese canon became the standard.
