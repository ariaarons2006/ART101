<div id="introduction">
<h2> Hi hi! Welcome to the website :3 </h2>
<p> I am a current undergraduate at UCSC in my sophomore year double majoring in Art, Games, and Playable Media as well as Literature. I have been an artist nearly my entire life, from doodling on the bottoms of tests to taking extracurricular classes for over ten years. In this time, I have developed my skills across several different mediums; including oil paint, acrylic, pen and ink, and pencil.  More recently, I have begun my study of digital mediums, including animation, storyboarding, and graphic design using Procreate as well as several Adobe Programs. My creativity and ability to think outside of the box is a key asset to any creative projects in the future. </p>
